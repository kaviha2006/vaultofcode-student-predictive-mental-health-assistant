🌱 Student Productivity & Mental Health Assistant – Java Project

This project is developed as part of the Vault of Codes Internship – Java Final Project (A4).
The goal of this application is to help students manage their academic tasks while also analyzing productivity behavior to identify burnout risk and encourage healthier study habits.

📌 Project Overview

Students often experience academic stress due to heavy workloads, poor task planning, and lack of rest. Most existing productivity tools focus only on task management and ignore mental well-being.

This project addresses that gap by combining task management with behavior-based wellness analysis. The system tracks study tasks, calculates productivity scores, analyzes behavioral factors such as sleep and workload, and predicts burnout risk using rule-based logic.

🔑 Key Features

Add and manage study tasks

Track task completion and productivity score

Analyze study behavior and sleep patterns

Predict burnout risk using rule-based logic

Provide adaptive wellness suggestions

Generate summary and analytics report

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

Core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

ArrayList for dynamic data handling

Rule-based analytical logic

Console-based application

🚀 How to Run the Project

Open the project in any Java-supported IDE (VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse).

Compile the program:

javac StudentAssistantApp.java


Run the application:
